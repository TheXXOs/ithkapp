Its use can be illustrated by taking the Ithkuil word for soldier in the DISCRETE configuration and comparing its English translations when inflected for the CONSOLIDATIVE affiliation (= <i>a group of soldiers</i>) versus the ASSOCIATIVE (= <i>a troop, a platoon</i>). It is this CONSOLIDATIVE versus ASSOCIATIVE distinction, then, that would distinguish otherwise equivalent plural inflections of the Ithkuil word for tree by translating them respectively as <i>a grove</i> versus <i>an orchard</i>.<br/><br/>The ASSOCIATIVE affiliation can also be used with nouns in the UNIPLEX (plexity) to signify a sense of unity amongst one\'s characteristics, purposes, thoughts, etc. For example, the word <i>person</i> inflected for the UNIPLEX and ASSOCIATIVE would translate as <i>a single-minded person</i>. Even nouns such as <i>rock</i>, <i>tree</i> or <i>work of art</i> could be inflected this way, subjectively translatable as <i>a well-formed rock</i>, <i>a tree with integrity</i>, <i>a “balanced” work of art</i>.<br/><br/>With verbs, the ASSOCIATIVE signifies that the act, state or event is by design or with specific purpose. The CONSOLIDATIVE versus ASSOCIATIVE distinction could be used, for example, with the verb <i>turn</i> in \\"I <i>turned</i> toward the window\\" to indicate whether it was for no particular reason or due to a desire to look outside."},"COA":{"name":"Coalescent","desc":"The COALESCENT affiliation indicates that the members of a configurational set share in a <b>complementary relationship</b> with respect to their individual functions, states, purposes, benefits, etc. This means that, while each member\'s function is distinct from those of other members, each serves in furtherance of some greater unified role. For example, the Ithkuil word translating English <i>toolset</i> would be the word for tool in some plural configuration (depending on each tool\'s distinct physical appearance) and the COALESCENT affiliation to indicate that each tool has a distinct but complementary function in furtherance of enabling construction or repair activities. Another example would be using the COALESCENT with the word for <i>(piece of) food</i> to signify a well-balanced meal.<br/><br/>The COALESCENT naturally appears most often in conjunction with the DUPLEX since binary sets tend to be complementary. It is used, for example, to signify symmetrical binary sets such as body parts, generally indicating a lefthand/righthand mirror-image distinction, e.g., <i>one\'s ears, one\'s hands, a pair of wings</i>. Pairs that do not normally distinguish such a complementary distinction (e.g. <i>one\'s eyes</i>) can nevertheless be optionally placed in the COALESCENT affiliation to emphasize bilateral symmetry (e.g., <i>one\'s left and right eye functioning together</i>).<br/><br/>With verbs, the COALESCENT signifies that related, synergistic nature of the component acts, states, and events which make up a greater holistic act, state, or event. It imposes a situational structure onto an act, state, or event, where individual circumstances work together in complementary fashion to comprise the total situation. It would be used, for example, to distinguish the sentences <i>He traveled in the Yukon</i> from <i>He ventured in the Yukon</i>, or <i>I came up with a plan</i> versus <i>I fashioned a plan</i>."},"VAR":{"name":"Variative","desc":"The VARIATIVE affiliation indicates that the individual members of a configurational set <b>differ as to subjective function, state, purpose or benefit</b>. The differences among members can be to varying degrees (i.e., constituting a fuzzy set in regard to function, purpose, etc.) or at complete odds with one another, although it should be noted that the VARIATIVE would not be used to signify opposed but complementary differences among set members (see the COALESCENT affiliation above). It would thus be used to signify <i>a jumble of tools, odds-and-ends, a random gathering, a rag-tag group, a dysfunctional couple, a cacophony of notes, of a mess of books, a collection in disarray</i>.<br/>It operates with nouns in the UNIPLEX to render meanings such as <i>a man at odds with himself, an ill-formed rock, a chaotic piece of art, a “lefthand-righthand” situation</i>.<br/><br/>With verbs, the VARIATIVE indicates an act, state, or event that occurs for more than one reason or purpose, and that those reasons or purposes are more or less unrelated. This sense can probably be captured in English only through paraphrase, as in <i>She bought the house for various reasons</i> or <i>My being at the party served several purposes</i>. With non-UNIPLEX configurations, the use of the VARIATIVE affiliation can describe rather complex phenomena; for example, a sentence such as <i>The light is blinking</i> in conjunction with the VARIATIVE could mean that each blink of the light signals something different than the preceding or following blinks."}},"popupdesc":"Affiliation distinguishes the relationships between individual members of a set in terms of purpose, function, and/or benefit.<br/><br/>Affiliation operates synergistically in conjunction with Configuration to describe the total contextual relationship between the members of a set.
